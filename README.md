# Contents & Purpose

This repository contains the models used by LHC dark matter searches, starting from the Dark Matter Forum models. 
The preferred approach is to have one and only one public repostitory of a given model to avoid any issues with diverging versions or propagating bugfixes in the future. Models that are made public using other repositories rather than this one should be linked from the [External Models](#external-models) section of this readme file.


## Citation Policy

When using those models, please cite the original papers (see the README / text file in the model folder for more information) as well as the appropriate Dark Matter Forum and Dark Matter Working Group papers: 
- Dark Matter Benchmark Models for Early LHC Run-2 Searches: Report of the ATLAS/CMS Dark Matter Forum: [arXiv:1507.00966](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.00966)
- LHC Dark Matter Working Group: Next-generation spin-0 dark matter models: [arXiv:1810.09420](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09420)

## t-channel White Paper Models

A working directory containing UFOs of models with t-channel mediators studied in the LHC DM WG within the scope of the corresponding White Paper is availalbe [here](https://github.com/LHC-DMWG/model-repository/tree/master/t-channel_WP_work).


## Additional Information

This is a clone of the Dark Matter Forum repository which was originally available [here](https://svnweb.cern.ch/cern/wsvn/LHCDMF/trunk/models/).
